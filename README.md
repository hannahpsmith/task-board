# Task Board


## Description
This application is a simple Kanban Task Board, used to divid up tasks by To Do, In Progress, and Done. The tasks can easily be moved between the three columns by simply dragging and dropping the tasks. The tasks will change color based on the deadline. They will default to white, then change to yellow when the deadline is nearing. For tasks that are due today or are past due, they will change to red.
